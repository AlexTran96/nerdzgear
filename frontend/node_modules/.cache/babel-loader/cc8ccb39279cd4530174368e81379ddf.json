The idea is to keep working products in use as long as possible, extending their life, preventing e-Waste, and ensuring you receive value for the electronics you don't need anymore. It's an idea we call reCommerce.</p>\r\n                                            <p>Once we have checked out your item and payment has been sent, we move the item into one of a few directions depending on what it is and what condition it's in.</p>\r\n                                            <p>Many of the products sent to NerdGearz still have plenty of life left in them so we find them a new, happy home. We do this by selling many of the items through our NerdGearz store. This is the essence of reCommerce - you sell your unwanted gadgets to us and we extend their life by selling them to someone who wants it. As a result, fewer items get thrown to the landfills or collect dust in a drawer, and fewer people buy brand new gadgets since used ones in great condition are available in the market.</p>\r\n                                            <p>Some products that we receive in large quantity are sold to wholesale partners, who aggregate these items and resell them via their own networks globally. A smaller portion of products that are sent to us are at the end of their useful life and are sent to domestic recycling partners who abide by the highest standards.</p>\r\n                                            <p>The idea is to optimize where to move things in order to get the best return and therefore offer the best value possible to our customers.</p>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div class=\"accordion-item\">\r\n                                    <h2 class=\"accordion-header\" id=\"flush-headingFive\">\r\n                                        <button\r\n                                            class=\"accordion-button collapsed\"\r\n                                            type=\"button\"\r\n                                            data-mdb-toggle=\"collapse\"\r\n                                            data-mdb-target=\"#flush-collapseFive\"\r\n                                            aria-expanded=\"false\"\r\n                                            aria-controls=\"flush-collapseFive\"\r\n                                        >\r\n                                            How long does it take to receive my payment?\r\n  </button>\r\n                                    </h2>\r\n                                    <div\r\n                                        id=\"flush-collapseFive\"\r\n                                        class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\"\r\n                                        aria-labelledby=\"flush-headingFive\"\r\n                                        data-mdb-parent=\"#accordionFlushExample\"\r\n                                    >\r\n                                        <div class=\"accordion-body\">\r\n                                            <p>Once we receive your item</p>\r\n                                            <p>It should only take a day or two for it to be processed.
